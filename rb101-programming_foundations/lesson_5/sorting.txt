Sorting
  - sorting is mostly performed on arrays; since items in arrays are 
    accessed via their index  


The <=> Method
  - sometimes referred to as the 'spaceship' operator

  - any object in a collection that we want to sort must implement a <=> method
    - performs comparison between two objects of the same type and returns
      a -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether the first object is less than, equal to,
      or greater than the second object
    - the return value of <=> is used by sort to determine the order in which
      to place the items
