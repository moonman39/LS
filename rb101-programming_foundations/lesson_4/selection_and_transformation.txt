Selection and Transformation
  - Selection is picking certain elements out of the collection depending
    on some criterion
    - if there are n elements in a collection, selection results in n or
      less elements
  - Transformation refers to manipulating every element in the colleciton
    - always results in exactly n elements
  
  - selection and transformation both utilize the basics of looping: a loop,
    a counter, a way to retrieve the current value, and a way to exit the
    loop
  
  - selection and transformation require some critiera
    - selection uses this criteria to determine which elements are selected
    - transformation uses this criteria to deterime how to performe the
      transformation



Looping to Select and Transform

  alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
  selected_chars = ''
  counter = 0

  loop do
    current_char = alphabet[counter]

    if current_char == 'g'
      selected_chars << current_char
    end

    counter += 1
    break if counter == alphabet.size
  end



Extracting to Methods
  - most of the time, selecting or transforming a collection is a very specific
    action, which naturally lends the specific action being extracted into 
    convenience methods


def double_numbers(numbers)
  counter = 0

  loop do
    break if counter == numbers.size

    current_number = numbers[counter]
    numbers[counter] = current_number * 2

    counter += 1
  end

  numbers
end
