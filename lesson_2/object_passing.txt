What is Object Passing?
  - in Ruby, almost everything is an object
  - when you call a method with some expression as an argument, that expression
    is evaluated by ruby and reduced, ultimately, to an object
    - the expression can be an object literal, a variable name, or a complex
      expression; regardless, it is reduced to an object
    - Ruby then makes that object available inside the method
      - this is called object passing
  
  - in addition to method arguments, the caller (sometimes called the receiver)
    of a method call - the object on which the method is called - can be thought
    of as an implied argument
